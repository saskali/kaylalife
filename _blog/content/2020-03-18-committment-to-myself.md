Uff... It is time. It is time that I start using my voice.

It feels scary. What if people don't like what I say? What if they will want to start arguments? I do not want to argue. I did that for many years and I am tired of it. Or what if even worse people will abandon and reject me?

I am willing to face those fears. I know why they are there, they have been serving and protecting me for a long time. When in doubt if my needs for acceptance, belonging and love could be met, my protection mechanism was there to prevent any further pain and suffering. It it time to release those fears and mechanisms now, so that I can step into a new reality. 

It is safe for me to be seen. 

It is safe to speak my truth. 

The more I welcome all of me, the more I will find people who love me and hold me in all of who I am. 

The beauty and the mess.

For years, I have been scared to be seen and heard. Standing in front of people was my horror scenario. My upbringing made me believe that I am not worthy to be heard, that my voice doesn't matter, that as a woman I was somehow inferior and would never be good enough. It started with voices from the outside and quickly internalised into a belief system that kept me small and prevented me from living my potential.

Why is there a strong call to start using my voice now? To be honest, the call has been there for a long time. I am ready to surrender my fears now because I feel deeply connected and alive in my body, have a bunch of wonderful people supporting me and most important of all, I have deep trust in life.

What I intend is to share from my own experience, because I know it can help others, spread inspiration and raise the awareness around topics that we do not talk about even though they are important for all of us. 

I want to invite you to read my words with an open heart. Take what works for you and let go of the pieces that don't resonate. 

I invite courage to speak our truth, especially for those of us who tend to be silent. Can we be present with each other and listen with openness and compassion? There is so much that we hold back and suppress. I have seen the shift in spaces where we can fully show up with all what is alive inside of us and it is time to cultivate the ability for more spaces in which our emotions and vulnerability are welcome.
